# ChatApp


This application is built using Node.js, React, and MongoDB and includes a real-time chat feature that allows at least two users to send messages to each other. Additionally, the application fetches data from another online source and stores it in the database. The frontend presents statistical data about the stored data and updates in real-time whenever there is a change in the database.
